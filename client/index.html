        <p>Allowing the ability to upload and view photos with a virtual reality feel.</p>
      </div>


        
        <p>Phodome allows users to view and upload photos in a virtual reality style environment. The user will be able to share photos that they would like to share to their personal profile page. Friends will be able to view their page and see all of the pictures that they have posted.</p>

        <p>Photo sharing has come a long way over the past few years, but we feel that with new technology comes new opportunites. With virtual reality emerging on the market, we can update how the user can view and share photos.</p>

        <p>The virtual reality market is growing exponentially and we believe that Phodome will be able to use this growth to give their users a better experience in photo sharing. The 3D aspect will be fun for users and will also make the experience more interactive.</p>

        <p>"Photos should make you feel something and that's what Phodome is about."</p>

        <p>In two easy steps you can be sharing your photos with your friends. The first step is uploading the pictures you want to share and the second step is organizing them.</p>

        <p>"I felt like I was there in the photos. It really brought a new view to looking at pictures."</p>

        <p>Phodome is pushing photo sharing into a whole new view. Join us at Phodome.com to start your adventure.</p>
