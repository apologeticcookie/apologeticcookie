There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
> Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
Phodome

## Sub-Heading ##
> Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
Phodome allows social media users the ability to upload and view photos with a virtual reality feel.

## Summary ##
> Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
Phodome allows users to view and upload photos in a virtual reality style environment. The user will be able to share photos that they would like to share to their personal profile page. Friends will be able to view their page and see all of the pictures that they have posted.

## Problem ##
> Describe the problem your product solves.
Photo sharing has come a long way over the past few years, but we feel that with new technology comes new opportunites. With virtual reality emerging on the market, we can update how the user can view and share photos.

## Solution ##
> Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
The virtual reality market is growing exponentially and we believe that Phodome will be able to use this growth to give their users a better experience in photo sharing. The 3D aspect will be fun for users and will also make the experience more interactive.

## Quote from You ##
> A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
"Photos should make you feel something and that's what Phodome is about."

## How to Get Started ##
> Describe how easy it is to get started.
In two easy steps you can be sharing your photos with your friends. The first step is uploading the pictures you want to share and the second step is organizing them.

## Customer Quote ##
> Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
"I felt like I was there in the photos. It really brought a new view to looking at pictures."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
> Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
Phodome is pushing photo sharing into a whole new view. Join us at Phodome.com to start your adventure.
